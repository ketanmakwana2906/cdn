It is an honor and a matter of pride to have worked significantly in the core module of the app, **scheduling**, by resolving critical issues such as train deactivations, `is_active` variable updates, and handling of special and inactive trains, ensuring smooth functionality.  

In the **blog module**, I implemented Redis caching, resolved issues like drafted blogs not being visible to admins, and ensured seamless handling of inactive trains in the running status.  

For **marketing tasks**, I updated WhatsApp templates in Gupshup, managed database operations for Zomato coupons, created new offer pages, and deployed environment variables for offers in production.  

In the **Trainman backend**, I configured the PayLater option with necessary fields and validated UPI payment addresses through the PayU API to streamline payment processes.  

For the **Tender Management project**, I developed key modules, including authentication, admin, and vendor functionalities, ensuring efficient bid management and tender publishing.  

I also contributed to **cron-related issues** by resolving dropdown list updates and improving the handling of inactive trains in running statuses.  

By maintaining a positive attitude, ensuring timely task delivery, taking ownership of the scheduling module, and addressing escalations, I consistently upheld quality and team reliability.  

Efforts were made to improve communication by listening effectively, resolving team concerns, and maintaining professionalism in emails and interactions for smooth collaboration.
