**Subject:** Review of Implementation: First vs Second Method

**Message:**

Sir,  
Please review the implementation. I have implemented the second method, and here's the research behind it:

- **In the method I implemented:** The issue arises due to the N+1 query problem. Displaying related fields causes Django to make one query for the main table and additional queries for each related object, significantly increasing database load.

- **In the second method you implemented:** It's more efficient because it allows Django to automatically use the string representation of the related object. This reduces the need for extra queries and fetches the `type_name` in a single query, optimizing database performance.

This version is concise yet clear, explaining both methods and their impact effectively.
