Sir research on that is 

In method that i implemented : the issue due to N+1 query problem , where displaying related fileds it causes django to make one query for the main table and additional query for each related object, significantly increasing DB load



The 2nd method you implemented : effcient because it allows django to automatically use the string representation of the related object , this reduces the need for extra queries and fetches the type_name in single query
