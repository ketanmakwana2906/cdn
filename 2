It is an honor and a matter of pride to have contributed significantly to the core module of the app, scheduling, along with other critical areas. I ensured timely task delivery, resolved key issues such as train deactivations, inactive status updates, and DOO mismatches, and implemented enhancements like handling special trains and enabling Redis caching. I played a pivotal role in developing modules for the Tender Management project and streamlined processes for marketing tasks, such as offer page updates and UPI validation. By maintaining a positive attitude, taking ownership of critical modules, and addressing escalations effectively, I consistently ensured quality in deliverables. Additionally, I made efforts to improve communication by being a good listener, resolving concerns, and maintaining professionalism in emails and team interactions, fostering collaboration and contributing positively to the teamâ€™s success.
